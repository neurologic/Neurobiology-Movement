  > This review summarizes the logics of the neural control of motion extending from the basal ganglia mechanisms responsible for selection of behavior and cortex for precision walking to the cellular and molecular design of the central pattern generator networks in the brain stem-spinal cord.
- The eigenmode is to an oscillating system what an eigenvector is to a linear system: a direction where the transformation creates only a linear scaling.
    > An eigenmode is a natural vibration of a system such that various parts all move together at the same frequency. The different parts all move sinusoidally at the same frequency and their amplitudes all increase or decrease in proportion to one another. There can be phase differences for different parts of the system. The frequency for a particular mode is called the eigenfrequency. A description of the amplitudes and phases of the various parts can be called the mode shape. A system will typically have discrete modal frequencies and associated mode shapes. Other arbitrary motions do not satisfy the equations of motion to get the nice systematic behavior of a mode. But that arbitrary motion can be expressed as a linear combination of different modes (as long as the system is linear). ([Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-is-an-eigenmode))
