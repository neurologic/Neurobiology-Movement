# Kinematics

- What is movement (from an observational perspective, not philosophical)?
- How do we describe and quantify movement?
- What is the motor system doing (ie what is its output)?

Kinematics is a branch of study focused on the description of motion (how high, how far, how fast!) and kinetics is a branch focused on the explanation of motion (the forces that cause changes in motion). 

Movement is the result of the intersection between the bodily affordances and the motor control system.
