Format:
Learning Roadmap
Content:
10 concepts learned
3 techniques learned
3 connections to material from previous courses
Think of this like a "concept map". A concept map is a diagram or graphical tool that visually represents relationships between concepts and ideas. Most concept maps depict ideas as boxes or circles (also called nodes), which are connected with lines or arrows (also called arcs). Each arc has a connecting phrase written that links the two concepts being connected. Each concept can be linked with just one or with multiple others. In your learning roadmap, each concept will be a node that is represented by a figure or diagram that you make from the materials you have used this semester. You can draw these, use figures from the Colab Notebooks, use images from the internet or journal papers, etc. In addition to creating figures/diagrams to visualize each concept/technique you are including, a goal of this roadmap is to make connections among the concepts and techniques that you are including. 
Each node needs a legend (legend not discussion) describing what is shown. Each link between nodes needs a word or phrase describing the link (directionality can be denoted using arrows). 
Each prepositional phrase in the concept map needs to be explained in more detail using a numbered list (numbers should be included with each arrow in the map to reference this list). 
You will have (at minimum) 16 nodes total (10 concepts learned, 3 techniques learned, 3 connections to material from previous courses). More can be added to connect your items if wanted/needed.
Here is a site with instructions for making a large-format powerpoint slide: https://www.lifewire.com/make-poster-in-powerpoint-4174840. “Prezi” is also a good free tool available via the internet.

Summary. In addition to your diagrammatic roadmap, write a brief discussion section that provides a summary and overview of your main take-away from the course. What approaches do you think provide the most value to the field? Which aspects of the field would you be most interested in pursuing further? How would you go about doing this? This should not need to be more than a page.
