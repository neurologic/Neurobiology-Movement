## Background and Introduction  

The motor system does much more than contract muscles. Even the most basic movements such as walking require whole-body coordination that must be learned and adapted to our environment. During active sensation, motor systems even modulate our sensory perceptions. Much of what we have learned about motor systems comes from animals as diverse as crickets, electric fish, and birds. This course uses a comparative approach to understand the functions various brain regions contribute to our active lives.

*General topics covered in this course include*: kinematics, neural and muscle electrophysiology, central pattern generators, action-specific neural circuits, motor cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, corollary discharge.

By the end of this course, students should be able to:
- Formulate and support an opinion about how each part of the motor system contributes to motor control.
- Interpret the main types of data that can be collected and interpret processed metrics.
- Explain neural mechanisms involved in the production of a motor sequence by an animal.
- Explore raw data through interactive visualizations.

You should gain skills in:
- The scientific study of animal behavior and the motor system 
- Visual presentation of information
- Analytical thinking
- Reading primary literature

Of you I ask:
- Come to class having thoroughly read the reading and completed any assignments ahead of time. Try to figure out things you have questions about. Note down anything you are wondering or related concepts you think of. Etc
- Remember the basic perspective on any scientific result: don’t believe it is true. Don’t take published papers at face value.
- Respect to yourself and others in the class. Different people have different backgrounds, interests, and learning styles. All are important to consider.
- Independence and self-motivation. This is your education. The learning process belongs to you.
- That you have fun and explore.

We’ll be working together to create an equitable and inclusive environment of mutual respect, in which we all feel comfortable to share our moments of confusion, ask questions, and challenge our understanding. Everyone should be able to succeed in this course. If you do not feel that is the case please let me know. 

You are encouraged to *scrutinise* and *question* learning material as you explore topics in your own way. I, as the instructor, am here to serve as your coach from the sidelines. The goal is for you to develop your own understanding of the topics and practice the skills needed to be a life-long learner -- skills that you can apply to learning anything, in academia, your career, or life in general. Among the broader skill goals that you will be working on are: Communication, Collaboration, Critical Thinking, and Creativity.

This class is about more than Animal Behavior as a topic itself. The content of the "animal behavior" is vast. This course is curated to mentor you in "thinking like an animal behavior scientist" - a priority greater than the task of '*knowing*' all specific details of behaviors we discuss. Outside of the course, many of you are unlikely to be regularly applying most (if any) of the specific content knowledge about each sub-topic or behavior that we explore inside this course. This is not to diminish the importance of this content, but rather to emphasize the importance of getting more than just content "knowledge" memorization out of this (and any) classroom experience. In this course (and others) I hope you find inspiration and develop *your own interests*, and develop the skills to go on to study those interests in depth in your own unique ways. 

The materials used in this course have been thoughtfully curated and designed to meet the following standards as published in “[The New Blueprints: Undergraduate Neuroscience Education in the Twenty-First Century.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6153019/)“ 
Specifically, this course works toward the following goals:
- To have students explore neuroscience more deeply by:
  - Increasing exposure to primary literature
  - Engaging them in analysis of research and research findings
  - Providing experiences in presenting research findings, orally, visually, and in writing
Involving them in more sophisticated analytic, quantitative, computational, and empirical work
- To promote students becoming independent investigators in neuroscience by gaining:
  - an in-depth understanding of primary literature;
  - facility with sophisticated quantitative and computational skills;

Some of the materials challenge you to interact with and analyze raw data. I ask that you keep a growth mindset and understand that [there is no such thing as a computational person](https://medium.com/the-spike/there-is-no-such-thing-as-a-computational-person-cca658b5c8f9).

The assessment in this course requires that you formulate your own opinions and models and curate what information you think is relevant to express those opinions. This structure is a bit open-ended, which can feel uncomfortable. You will not be told what to prioritize in your editorials, which can feel uncomfortable. Classroom discussions will revolve around what you find interesting and challenging. You do not need to “know the answer” to contribute to discussions. Be open to dialog and debate and to holding conflicting ideas in your mind.

For this course you will read journal papers. Students often have two reactions to journal papers: (1) I don’t understand a word of this, please can I have my textbook back? (Answer: no, because the textbook is wrong). And (2) it’s published, so it must be true. This is nonsense. Papers are, in all probability, wrong. Do not defer to authority, but be constructively skeptical – ask of a paper basic questions: “do the claims follow from the actual results?”; “What could have been done better?”; “What could be done next?”. We need to remember a simple truth: Every paper is an idea – it says “hey look at this, this could be cool”. Not “This is The Truth.” ([Excerpt from Mark Humphries](https://medium.com/the-spike/most-research-i-publish-will-be-wrong-and-im-ok-with-that-3440e795358d))



:::{epigraph}
It is important that students bring a certain ragamuffin[^ragamuffin], barefoot irreverence to their studies; they are not here to worship what is known but to question it

-—  Jacob Bronowski, The Ascent of Man
:::

[^ragamuffin]: Oxford languages defines it as: "*a person, typically a child, in ragged, dirty clothes*". It is also a breed of cat. The term ragamuffin is used affectionately in this context of recognizing the value of rugged scrappiness. Though its roots are in describing a lazy and worthless, or beggarly individual. In the early 19th century the word became associated with the children who would dress up for Thanksgiving as ragamuffins and parade asking for handouts, parodying begging and beggars. I have not found any resources informing that this word is derogatory or discriminatory nor contains any racial undertones. If you are informed otherwise do not hesitate to edit this quote for the syllabus.

***Attendence*** in classroom sessions is mandatory. If unforseeable emergency comes up, please reach out as soon as possible so that we can make a plan.  

In general, you can refer to the following general guidelines to gauge your expected grade in the course:
> “F” work results from minimal effort and attendance. Absence from classroom sessions even if assignments were completed.  
  “D” work shows insufficient levels of understanding. With no effort to remedy misunderstandings. Writing and presentation of material is disorganized and unclear and/or incomplete.   
  “C” work shows a basic level of understanding. The bare minimum required has been addressed, but there is minimal effort toward personal exploration of the material. Work generally contains errors and is kind of disorganized, even though correct elements are included.   
  “B” work shows a very good understanding of the concepts and demonstrates logical thinking. Not much independent synthesis and extension of the material beyond what was directly discussed in class.  
  “A” work shows excellent grasp of the concepts and the importance of the topic and demonstrates clear logical thinking and reasoning. Writing and presentation of material is clear and concise and grabs the reader’s attention. It stimulates the reader to learn more to enhance their understanding of the subject. Information is used synthetically to make one or more original connections with/among course topics.

**Deadlines**
Assignment due dates are available from the start of the semester. Students are expected to meet all deadlines. Extracurricular activities (sports, social/volunteer activities) and other academic commitments are unacceptable excuses for rescheduling requests. Rescheduling a test will only be considered in unforeseen and extreme circumstances. 

**Time Commitment**  
Attendence in classroom sessions is mandatory. If your in-class work is finished before the classroom session ends, you can use the additional time to work on Take Home work or explore the preparation further. I have designed the class so that it should be feasible to satisfactorily complete the requirements with approximately twelve hours per week of time commitment (as per the standards for a full credit course). If you are spending more time than this on a regular basis I encourage you to check in with me.

I remind students of [the Wesleyan honor code](http://www.wesleyan.edu/studentaffairs/honorboard/honorcode.html) which you signed as a first-year student. I value your academic integrity and therefore require that you sign the following summary pledge: ***In accordance with the Honor Code, I affirm that all work for this course expresses my own contributions (including in collaboration with others) and all content taken from other sources has been properly acknowledged. I affirm that all work is completed without improper assistance.***
 
For written and multimedia work: In accordance with the Honor Code, I affirm that this work is my own and all content taken from other sources has been properly acknowledged
 
It is expressly forbidden to submit work from another course without my permission. While written reports will be accepted, they must be accompanied by an electronic format too. Submitting only in electronic format is acceptable. Please note that active checking for plagiarism will occur. Ensure that all sources are cited and in sufficient detail for the reader to locate your primary source. Consult with me if you are uncertain whether a source needs citing. Don’t risk plagiarism as this is an academic violation with severe consequences. Should I suspect the honor code has been violated, I will consult the Vice President for Student Affairs to decide whether to refer the matter to the Honor Board.


**Skills beyond content** 
More than eighty percent of employers surveyed indicated that undergraduate education should place more emphasis
on the following three areas:
- Critical thinking and analytical reasoning
- Problem solving and analysis
- Written and oral communication

**Problems versus Exercises**
A problem exists when one does not know what to do or does not have an internalized
algorithm for obtaining an answer. If one knows what to do, it’s not a problem—it is an
exercise. Many STEM textbooks have numerous numbered items at the end of each chapter
for students to solve; regardless of how these are labeled, in most cases the vast majority of
these items are exercises, not problems. That is, students in general know what to do when
they encounter these items: they either have an internalized algorithm for generating a
correct answer, or they know that what they need to do to generate a correct answer is to look
back through the chapter for a sample item that is phrased similarly and then mimic the
solution that is presented there.
