    "# Kinematics and Kinetics of Walking\n",
    "\n",
    "We can’t understand anything about how the nervous system organizes and controls a movement until we can understand the movement itself and the biomechanics of the body controlled by the nervous system. \n",
    "\n",
    "Kinematics is the study and quantification of how objects move. In working through the contents of this notebook, you will learn more about movement and how it is measured and analyzed. You will also practice using data processing and visualization techniques common to neuroscience, physics, biology, and many data science professions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will learn about how (some) human bodies walk in the context of current standard practices in the fields of biomechanics. The [dataset you will explore](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5722711) was published by [Fukuchi et al (2018)](https://peerj.com/articles/4640/). They placed markers placed at specific locations along the body were tracked during walking (either overland or on a treadmill). Note that the nomenclature for the marker points in this dataset vary slightly from [the marker placement resource](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0966636207000124?via%3Dihub) referenced in Fukuchi et al (2018). See marker key in slides from class. Force plates were used to quantify ground contact forces during walking (\"kinetics\").\n",

    "Your work on this notebook will scaffold discussions throughout the course about kinematics of a variety of movements, the challenges faced by the nervous system in controlling movement, and emerging technologies that are revolutionizing ways of quantifying movement. \n",
