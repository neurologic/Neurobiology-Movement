# Introduction

In this course we are surveying the literature, core concepts, and tools to explore how the healthy brian functions in movement. During class, we will use our own movement experiences to scaffold the synthesis of diverse topics in motor control. You have the opportunity to go deeper into your own unique interests through your editorials, which incorporate what you are learning into an expression of your own ideas about the neurobiology of movement. We will not work under the illusion of neat and tidy.
